## Intro

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), co-advised by [Prof. Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/karriekarahalios.html) and [Prof. Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/). My general research interest investigates how human interacts with and make decisions through technology-mediated instruments. My current research focuses on collective decision-making mechanism design and decision-making through data visualizations. I am a full-stack web developer and a technology educator when not doing research. Read more about me via my homepage <a class="dotted" href="http://tichung.com">here</a>.
